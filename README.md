# RopeProject

This Unity 5 project is a demonstration of a rope or leash that can be used to constrain a CharacterController.

After loading, start the "Default" scene and press play.


## Why this repository exists

This repository is a response to a reddit comment (see: http://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/37f5n2/perhaps_the_most_fun_mechanic_ive_made/crml501). I thought I would share my prototype implementation in hopes that others could improve one it.

It may be worth emphasizing that this is pure prototype quality code and should be 100% rewritten before making it anywhere near a finished product.
